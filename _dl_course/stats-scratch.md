## Stream overview

__This stream is aimed at scientists who are looking to learn the R language for data manipulation and statistical analysis.__ No programming experience required, so it is ideal for students, postgraduate researchers, and anyone who has been using commercial software for data analysis and wishes they could have more flexibility in their analyses!

We will teach you the basic syntax of the R language, and right away you'll be using it to import, manipulate and plot data. You will get into the good habit of using scripts to write clear and reproducible code, and learn the most efficient tricks to prepare and tidy data for analysis in R. We will use a variety of ecological data to practice making graphs and running linear models. Soon you will have all the skills you need to analyse your own data and present the results in a professional way!

## As part of this course stream, we suggest you do the following tutorials:

* [Introduction to R and RStudio]({{ site.baseurl }}/tutorials/intro-to-r/index.html)
* [Troubleshooting and finding help]({{ site.baseurl }}/tutorials/troubleshooting/index.html)
* [Coding etiquette]({{ site.baseurl }}/tutorials/etiquette/index.html)
* [Data manipulation I: introduction to tidy data]({{ site.baseurl }}/tutorials/data-manip-intro/index.html)
* [Linear modelling]({{ site.baseurl }}/tutorials/modelling/index.html)
* [Data visualisation I: beautiful and informative graphs]({{ site.baseurl }}/tutorials/datavis/index.html)

## Getting started

We hope you enjoy doing the course! There is no time limit for completion, so you can take it at your own pace. Each tutorial might take you between one and three hours to complete, and your completion will be recorded once you take the quiz at the end.

You can download all the materials for this stream from our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ourcodingclub/CC_course_stream1).

If you are not yet registered for the course, visit our [info page]({{ site.baseurl }}/dl_course/) to sign up.

You can track your progression and access the course quizzes in our course portal.

## Challenge yourself

Have you completed all the tutorials you wanted to? Feel you're ready for some real-life applications? We encourage you to test your skills and take the challenge associated to this stream.

Our case-study challenges are designed to test the range of skills you gained throughout the course. We provide guidance but no step-by-step instructions, so your solution will be unique! A challenge might take you 4-8 hours to complete (get in touch if you get stuck!). The button below will take you to the challenge page where you can see what is required.
